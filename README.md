# SafeWallet Pay

A secure Mantle-based P2P payment platform with **escrow**, **refunds (including wrong-address sends)**, and **bulk transaction management**.  
Built on **Mantle Sepolia testnet (5003)** with **Web3Auth** onboarding and a modern React UI.

---

## 📋 Problem Statement

Traditional crypto payments have critical issues, especially for everyday users and businesses in :

- **No protection for wrong-address transfers**
  - If you paste or type the wrong wallet address, the funds are gone forever.
  - There is **no native “undo” or refund option** once a transaction is broadcast.
- **No escrow / claim process**
  - Funds are sent directly to the recipient with no “claim step”, making disputes and trust hard to manage.
- **No sender-controlled refunds**
  - Even if the recipient never uses or even sees the funds, the sender has no way to pull them back.
- **Inefficient bulk payouts**
  - Paying salaries, vendors, community members or grant recipients needs many on-chain transactions, increasing cost and complexity.
- **Complex onboarding & UX**
  - Seed phrases, network configuration, and raw hex addresses are intimidating for new users.
- **Infrastructure gaps**
  - Many users need low-fee, fast, programmable payments for micro‑transactions, remittances, and bulk payouts, but don't get that from traditional rails.

## 💡 Our Solution

SafeWallet Pay adds a **smart-contract escrow layer** and rich UI on top of Mantle:

1. **Escrow-first payments**
   - Funds are locked in the `SafePay` contract instead of going directly to the recipient.
2. **Claim-based receiving**
   - Recipients explicitly **claim** funds (MNT or ERC‑20) with a transaction ID.
3. **Refunds for unclaimed & misdirected funds**
   - If a payment is never claimed, the **sender can refund** and recover the funds.
   - This gives a safety net for **wrong-address transfers**, as long as the funds remain unclaimed in escrow.
4. **Bulk Transaction Manager**
   - Send many payments in a single transaction to save cost and simplify operations.
5. **Smooth onboarding**
   - Web3Auth enables social logins alongside traditional wallets.

Result: a safer, more forgiving payment flow that still feels like normal crypto.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Hedera-Payment-interface

# Frontend
pnpm install        # or: npm install

## 🔒 Security & Design Considerations

- **Escrow & Refund Logic**
  - Payments are **claim-based**; funds remain in escrow until claimed.
  - Senders can **refund unclaimed funds**, reducing damage from wrong-address mistakes.
- **Reentrancy & Safe Transfers**
  - `ReentrancyGuard` on state-changing functions.
  - `SafeERC20` for token transfers.
- **Access Control**
  - `Ownable` for admin operations and controlled upgrades.
- **Input & Amount Validation**
  - Frontend and contract-level checks for amounts, arrays, and addresses.
- **Mantle Benefits**
  - Low fees, fast finality, and Ethereum-compatible infrastructure with Layer 2 scalability.

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

- **Universal Payment Solution (Cross‑Chain, Any Token)**
  - Allow users to **create and manage payment requests** with:
    - Preferred blockchain (e.g. Mantle, EVM L2s, etc.),
    - Preferred token (MNT, stablecoins, or ERC‑20s),
    - Total amount to receive.
  - Generate a **payment link** that can be shared with the payer.
  - The receiver connects their wallet; if their funds are on **another chain or in another token**, the platform:
    - Requests **allowance** on the payer's chosen token/chain,
    - Automatically orchestrates **swap + bridge** steps behind the scenes,
    - Delivers funds to the receiver in their **preferred token on their preferred blockchain**.
  - Goal: make crypto payments feel like a single, universal payment network, regardless of where liquidity lives.
- **Unified Balance System**
  - Show a **single aggregated balance view** across multiple chains and tokens.
  - Normalize balances into a common unit (e.g. USD equivalent) while still showing per‑asset details.
  - Power better UX for the universal payment solution and future cross‑chain features.
- Better **UX messaging** around wrong-address mistakes and refund windows.
- Additional **tokens** and **stablecoins** on Mantle.
- **Fiat on‑ramp/off‑ramp** integration.
- Bulk payout analytics & CSV export.

SafeWallet Pay brings **safer, refundable and scalable bulk crypto payments** to Mantle — tailored for real users and businesses across the World.
